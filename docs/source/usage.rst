   environment
      A structure where information about all documents under the root is
      saved, and used for cross-referencing.  The environment is pickled
      after the parsing stage, so that successive runs only need to read
      and parse new and changed documents.

   source directory
      The directory which, including its subdirectories, contains all
      source files for one Sphinx project.

Since Pythagoras, we know that :math:`a^2 + b^2 = c^2`.

By default, inline code such as :code:`1 + 2` just displays without
highlighting.

To use Lumache, first install it using pip:

.. code-block:: console

   (.venv) $ pip install lumache


.. _installation:

Installation

Creating recipes
----------------

To retrieve a list of random ingredients,
you can use the ``lumache.get_random_ingredients()`` function:

.. py:function:: lumache.get_random_ingredients(kind=None)

   Return a list of random ingredients as strings.

   :param kind: Optional "kind" of ingredients.
   :type kind: list[str] or None
   :return: The ingredients list.
   :rtype: list[str]



The ``kind`` parameter should be either ``"meat"``, ``"fish"``,
or ``"veggies"``. Otherwise, :py:func:`lumache.get_random_ingredients`
will raise an exception.

.. py:function:: lumache.get_random_ingredients(kind=None)

   Return a list of random ingredients as strings.

   :param kind: Optional "kind" of ingredients.
   :type kind: list[str] or None
   :raise lumache.InvalidKindError: If the kind is invalid.
   :return: The ingredients list.
   :rtype: list[str]


>>> import lumache
>>> lumache.get_random_ingredients()
['shells', 'gorgonzola', 'parsley']
